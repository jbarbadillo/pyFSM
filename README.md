Simple FSM class for event driven application under GNU LGPL v3.0 license.

**pyFSM** is compatible with Python-2 and Python-3.

### What is pyFSM intended for?

This is class will be useful if you need to design a robust event driven system
with clear states where some tasks must be done. A good example is a state machine for
a robot that has to go from one position to another.
 
Currently is under development, so you will have to wait, but very soon you will be able to

- Create a FSM for a robust event driven application
